## Status Update

I am currently doing a major redesign and reimplementation of `okami`.
The original version is in the `legacy/` directory`, since I believe it's still worth checking out!
The somewhat unusual approach to Forth described in the following paragraphs is certainly interesting.
I always enjoyed using it, but I think I can create something much more worthwhile.
This first version of `okami` will, however, always have a place in my heart.
It shows that a mostly usable system can be extremely simple.

If you want to get an idea of what the new design is like, you can take a look at the work-in-progress specificiation in `spec.md`.
